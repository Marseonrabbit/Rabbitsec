### 🔧 **A Nuts-and-Bolts Description**

Think of the Internet as a **global network of interconnected devices**. These include:

- **Hosts (End Systems):** Computers, smartphones, TVs, smart thermostats, etc.
    
- **Communication Links:** Copper wire, fiber optics, radio waves (Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G)
    
- **Packet Switches:** Devices like **routers** and **link-layer switches** that move data
    
- **Internet Service Providers (ISPs):** These connect users and organizations to the Internet (e.g., Comcast, AT&T)
    

#### 💡 How Communication Works:

- Devices send **data in chunks** called **packets**
    
- Each packet travels across a **route of routers and links** to reach its destination
    
- Packet switches (routers) **store** and **forward** each packet
    

> 🎯 Analogy: Think of packets as **trucks**, links as **roads**, routers as **intersections**, and devices as **buildings**.

### 🧩 **1.1.2 A Services Description**

This perspective focuses on what the Internet **does**:

- The Internet acts as a **platform for applications** (email, video streaming, web browsing, etc.)
    
- **Applications run on end systems**, not inside the network switches or routers
    
- These apps **communicate using protocols** and **socket interfaces**
    

> 🧠 Imagine you're building an app like WhatsApp. You just write code that **sends and receives data via sockets**, and the Internet handles the delivery.

---

### 🔄 **What Is a Protocol?**

A **protocol** defines:

- The **format** of messages
    
- The **order** of message exchange
    
- The **actions** taken on sending or receiving messages
    

#### ✅ Example: HTTP Protocol (Web)

1. Browser sends request: `GET /index.html`
    
2. Server responds: sends the HTML file
    

> ⚠️ If both sides don't follow the **same protocol**, communication **fails**.

### 📝 **Summary of Section 1.1**

| Concept  | Explanation                                                |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Internet | A network of networks that connects billions of devices    |
| Host     | Devices that run applications (PCs, phones, smart things)  |
| Protocol | Agreed set of rules for communication                      |
| ISPs     | Provide Internet access to end users and content providers |
| Packet   | A unit of data transmitted through the Internet            |
| Router   | Device that forwards packets between networks              |

Now that you know how devices connect to the Internet’s edge, it’s time to understand **how data travels through the Internet**. This is the **core** of the network—made up of routers and links that move your data around the globe.

### 🔁 **1.3.1 Packet Switching**

In the Internet, data is sent in **packets**, not continuous streams. Here's how it works:

#### 📦 What is a Packet?

A **packet** is a small unit of data. Large messages (like emails or videos) are **split into packets**, sent separately, and reassembled at the destination.

#### 🔁 Store-and-Forward Transmission

Routers follow a **store-and-forward model**:

- A router **receives the entire packet**
    
- Then **forwards** it to the next router or destination
    

🧮 **Delay = (Packet Length) / (Link Bandwidth)**  
For example, if a 1,000-bit packet goes over a 1 Mbps link:  
Delay = 1000 bits / 1,000,000 bits/sec = **0.001 seconds (1 ms)**

#### 🌍 Route = Path through Network

Each packet may pass through **multiple routers** to get from source to destination.

### 🧠 **Circuit Switching (vs. Packet Switching)**

**Circuit Switching** is used in traditional phone networks.

|Feature|Packet Switching (Internet)|Circuit Switching (Old Telco)|
|---|---|---|
|Dedicated Path|❌ No|✅ Yes|
|Resource Use|✅ Shared|❌ Reserved|
|Flexibility|✅ Dynamic routing|❌ Static path|
|Efficiency|✅ High|❌ Low (idle circuits waste resources)|
|Example|Internet|Old telephone systems|

This section explains the devices and technologies **at the edge of the Internet**—what you directly use to access the web.

### 🖥️ **The Edge: End Systems & Access Networks**

#### 🔸 **End Systems (Hosts)**

These are the devices that people and applications use:

- **Clients:** PCs, smartphones, smart TVs, IoT devices
    
- **Servers:** Web servers, email servers, database servers
    
- **Cloud:** Data centers with thousands of servers (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud)
    

📌 **End systems = Hosts** – they "host" apps and communicate with each other over the Internet.

---

### 🔌 **Physical Media**

There are two main types of transmission media:

| **Type**     | **Examples**                                      | **Description**                              |

### 🌐 **Overview of Delay in Packet-Switched Networks**

A packet moves from a **source host**, through **routers**, to a **destination host**. Along its journey, it encounters various delays at each **node** (host or router):

#### Types of Delays:

1. **Processing Delay (`d_proc`)**
    
    - Time to examine packet header and determine where to forward it.
        
    - Includes error checks.
        
    - Typically microseconds.
        
2. **Queuing Delay (`d_queue`)**
    
    - Time the packet spends waiting in the queue for the link.
        
    - Varies with traffic intensity and nature.
        
    - Can be microseconds to milliseconds.
        
3. **Transmission Delay (`d_trans`)**
    
    - Time to push packet bits onto the link.
        
    - `d_trans = L / R` (L = packet size in bits, R = link bandwidth in bps)
        
    - For example, for a 1,000-bit packet and 1 Mbps link: `d_trans = 1 ms`.
        
4. **Propagation Delay (`d_prop`)**
    
    - Time for bits to physically travel to the next node.
        
    - `d_prop = d / s` (d = distance, s = propagation speed)
        
    - Speeds typically 2×10⁸ to 3×10⁸ m/s.
        

🧠 **Total nodal delay** =  
`d_nodal = d_proc + d_queue + d_trans + d_prop`

---

### 📊 **Queuing Delay and Packet Loss**

- Queuing delay is **highly variable** and depends on:
    
    - **Arrival rate (a)** = avg rate packets enter the queue
        
    - **Transmission rate (R)** = rate bits leave the queue
        
- **Traffic Intensity (La/R)**:
    
    - If `La/R > 1`, the queue grows without bound → **packet loss**.
        
    - As `La/R → 1`, **average queuing delay increases rapidly**.
        
    - Illustrated in **Figure 1.18**: steep rise in delay as La/R approaches 1.
        

#### 🧨 Packet Loss

- Occurs when a packet arrives and the **queue is full**.
    
- Lost packets may be **retransmitted** by transport protocols.
    

🧠 Performance is measured by:

- Average delay
    
- Probability of packet loss
    

---

### 🧮 **End-to-End Delay**

Let’s assume:

- There are `N-1` routers between source and destination.
    
- No congestion (queuing delay ≈ 0).
    

Let:

- `d_proc` = processing delay per node
    
- `d_trans` = transmission delay per node
    
- `d_prop` = propagation delay per node
    

Then the **total end-to-end delay** is:

dend−to−end=N⋅(dproc+dtrans+dprop)d_{end-to-end} = N \cdot (d_{proc} + d_{trans} + d_{prop})

Also, since `d_trans = L/R`, this becomes:

dend−to−end=N⋅(dproc+LR+dprop)d_{end-to-end} = N \cdot (d_{proc} + \frac{L}{R} + d_{prop})

This is a **generalization** of Equation 1.1.

---

### 🛠️ **Traceroute Tool Example**

- **Traceroute** measures **round-trip delay** to each router on a path.
    
- Shows how queuing and propagation delays vary.
    
- Example: a transatlantic fiber link causes a **sudden jump** in delay between routers.
    

---

### 🧩 **Other Delays in End Systems**

- **MAC-layer delays**: waiting to access a shared medium (e.g., WiFi)
    
- **Packetization delay**: time needed to collect voice data before sending a packet in VoIP
    
    - Affects user-perceived quality
        

---

### 🚀 **1.4.4 Throughput in Computer Networks**

Throughput = **rate of successful data delivery** (bits/sec)

#### Key Concepts:

- **Instantaneous throughput**: at any moment in time
    
- **Average throughput**: `F / T` for file size `F` over time `T`
    

#### Examples:

1. **Simple 2-link system**
    
    - Link from server to router: rate = Rs
        
    - Link from router to client: rate = Rc
        
    - **Throughput** = `min(Rs, Rc)` → **bottleneck rule**
        
2. **N-link path**
    
    - Throughput = `min{R1, R2, ..., RN}`
        
3. **Real-world scenario**
    
    - Core network is overprovisioned → access networks (Rs, Rc) limit throughput
        
4. **10 simultaneous transfers**
    
    - All flows traverse a **common link** with rate R.
        
    - Throughput = `R / 10` for each flow
