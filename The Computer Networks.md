## Architectural Principles
- The Tcp/IP protocol allows the devices with different statics(Hardware,Software)to communicate with each other.

###  Packets, Connections, and Data
- In the initial stage of network communication they usage channels to communicate but after that they created the packet switching where the small chunks of digital information flow through the network.
- chunks coming from different sources or sender can be mixed together and pulled apart later which calls multiplexing.
- the chunks can move around from one switch to this is not an ooptin
